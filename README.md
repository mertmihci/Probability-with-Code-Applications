#Probability Coding Implementations Repository
Welcome to the Probability Coding Implementations Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing coding implementations related to probability theory. It serves as a collection of assignments and projects from the EE230 Probability & Random Variables course offered by the Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) Department at Middle East Technical University (METU).

Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to provide practical examples and solutions to various probability problems encountered in the course curriculum. Through these implementations, learners can gain a deeper understanding of probability concepts and their applications in real-world scenarios.

Contents
The repository contains a variety of coding exercises, homework assignments, and projects covering fundamental topics in probability theory. These implementations are designed to illustrate concepts such as random variables, probability distributions, conditional probability, and more.

Contribution
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have additional coding implementations, improvements to existing code, or suggestions for new exercises, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance the learning experience for students and enthusiasts interested in probability theory.
